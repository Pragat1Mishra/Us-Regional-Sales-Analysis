# Regional Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of inconsistent revenue and profit performance across regions by providing deep insights into sales data. Leveraging 5 years of historical sales data, the goal is to pinpoint growth levers, optimize sales strategy, and enhance profitability.

## Key Features
* **End-to-End Data Analysis:** From raw data to actionable business insights.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovering trends and patterns in historical sales, margins, products, and channels.
* **Interactive Dashboard (Power BI):** A dynamic tool for stakeholders to self-serve insights, visualize trends, and monitor performance by time, product, region, and channel.
* **Actionable Recommendations:** Data-driven strategies for optimizing sales policies and operational planning.

## Technologies Used
* **Python:** For data loading, preprocessing (Pandas), and exploratory data analysis (NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
* **SQL:** For data querying and initial exploration (implicitly via data loading/consolidation).
* **Microsoft Power BI:** For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## Key Insights
* **Seasonal Fluctuations:** Consistent sales cycles with peak performance in late spring/early summer and annual lows in January.
* **Product Performance:** Products 26 & 25 are dominant in sales volume; Products 18 & 28 lead in profit margin.
* **Channel Effectiveness:** Wholesale drives volume, while Export yields higher profit margins.
* **Regional Disparities:** California and the West region show significant sales, with Northeast and Midwest regions performing lower.
* **Customer Value:** Aibox Company and State Ltd are top-tier customers by revenue, indicating high customer value concentration.

## Recommendations
* **Strategic Promotions:** Implement campaigns to counter seasonal dips (e.g., April) and amplify high-demand periods.
* **Product Portfolio Management:** Prioritize high-performing SKUs and re-evaluate less profitable ones.
* **Channel Strategy:** Optimize efforts across channels, leveraging Export for margins and Wholesale for volume.
* **Targeted Regional Investment:** Focus marketing and resources on underperforming regions to replicate successes from top regions.
* **Profitability Monitoring:** Proactively identify and address orders below target margin thresholds.
